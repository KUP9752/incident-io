# Internships

incident.io has an internship programme for student engineers who want to gain
work experience over summer (3 month) or industrial (6 month) placements.

We're looking for candidates that:

- Want to join a professional software engineering team to gain real world
  experience in the industry.
- Have great product taste and want to join a team where – alongside the
  challenge of building software – your skills thinking through product problems
  are equally valuable.
- Is excited by building software in the incident response space.

Do not apply if:

- You're looking for an 'intern' project: this placement will have you doing
  real work and we'll make little distinction between an intern vs a fulltime
  engineering hire.
- You don't enjoy learning new technologies by 'doing': we expect engineers to
  get involved building and learn as they go (most have learned Go while on the
  job, as an example).
- You prefer to work solo: we're highly collaborative and all your work will
  happen as part of a team.

## Applying

Please apply at [incident.io/careers](https://incident.io/careers), including a
CV detailing education and past experience and a cover letter that explains why
incident.io is particularly exciting to you.

We care more about the cover letter than the CV, so think carefully about why
this role is something you would do well in!
